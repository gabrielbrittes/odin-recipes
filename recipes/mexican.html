            <h2>Recipe instructions (taken from the book)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
                <li>While the beef is cooking, make stuffing. Bring water and butter to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in stuffing mix; cover. Remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
                <li>Stir diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, and hot sauce into the beef mixture. Simmer for 2 minutes. Add corn and Cheddar cheese. Simmer until cheese is melted completely, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a casserole dish. Spread cornbread stuffing evenly over the top.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
