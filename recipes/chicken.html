            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Pour fajita seasoning into a shallow bowl. Rinse chicken, blot dry with paper towels, and dredge in seasoning. Place in the prepared baking dish and pour frozen vegetables over top.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with mozzarella cheese. Return to the oven and bake until cheese is bubbly and starting to brown, and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
